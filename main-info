## Website Name:

Dwell Well



## Hex Colors:

Let's rebuild the website color scheme to complement your logo's green, blue, and "dirt" color (presumably a brown or beige tone). Here's a new approach:

**1. Inspiration from Your Logo:**

Since your logo has green, blue, and a "dirt" color (brown/beige), let's draw inspiration from these to create a harmonious palette.

**2. Core Colors:**

* **Primary:**  **Forest Green (#38A3A5)** - A rich and calming green that reflects nature and aligns with your eco-friendly products.
* **Secondary:**  **Sky Blue (#C2E0FC)** - A light and airy blue that complements the green and evokes a sense of openness.
* **Tertiary (or Accent):**  **Sandy Beige (#F5F3E5)** - A neutral beige that ties in with the "dirt" color in your logo and provides a grounding element.

**3. Applying the Colors:**

* **Headers (H1, H2, H3):**  Forest Green (#38A3A5) - Creates a bold and clear distinction for main titles.
* **Smaller Headers (H4, H5, H6):**  Sky Blue (#C2E0FC) - Provides a contrasting color for subheadings. 
* **Text (Body Text, Paragraphs):**  Charcoal Gray (#333333) - Ensures good readability on various backgrounds.
* **Page Background:**  Sandy Beige (#F5F3E5) - Creates a clean and warm foundation.

**4. Navigation Bar:**

* **Background:**  Two options:
    * **Light Sky Blue (#D9EEF9)** - A lighter shade of the secondary color for a more subtle look.
    * **Sandy Beige (#F5F3E5)** - Matches the page background for a cohesive feel.
* **Text Color:** 
    * **Darker Forest Green (#2E7D7F)** - If using the light blue background for the navbar.
    * **Charcoal Gray (#333333)** - If using the sandy beige background for the navbar.

**5. Buttons:**

* **Primary Button:**  Forest Green (#38A3A5) - Represents the main call to action.
* **Secondary Button (Optional):**  Sky Blue (#C2E0FC) - For less prominent actions.
* **Bright Orange Button (Optional - #F7813E):** Dark text color like black (#333333) or a very dark gray (#333333) for best contrast.

**5.1 Text Color on Buttons:**

* **High Contrast:** The most important factor is to ensure high contrast between the text color and the button background color. This guarantees good readability for users.
* **Light Background, Dark Text:** For buttons with light-colored backgrounds (e.g., white, beige, light blue), use a dark text color like black or a very dark gray (#333333) for optimal readability.
* **Dark Background, Light Text:** For buttons with dark-colored backgrounds (e.g., your forest green #38A3A5 button), use a light text color like white or a very light gray (#F2F2F2) for clear visibility.

**6. Buttons Hover:**

* **Primary Button:**  A slightly darker shade of Forest Green (#2E7D7F) - Creates a darkening effect on hover.
* **Secondary Button:**  A slightly lighter shade of Sky Blue (#D9EEF9) - Provides a subtle hover effect.

**7. Links:**

* **Regular Link:**  Sky Blue (#C2E0FC)
* **Hover Link:**  A slightly darker shade of Sky Blue (#B2D7F2)

**8. Icons:**

* Use either a shade of Forest Green (#38A3A5) or Sky Blue (#C2E0FC) depending on the specific icon for consistency.

**Remember:**

* You can fine-tune the shades based on your logo colors and overall design preferences. 
* Use online color palette tools to experiment and visualize how these colors work together.
